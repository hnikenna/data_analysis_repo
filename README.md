# Data Analysis With Python

Below are few projects I have developed pertaining to Data Analysis, 
Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence
---
### Table of content
* Demographic Data Analyzer
* Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator
* Medical Data Visualizer
* Page View Time Series Visualizer
* Sea Level Predictor

[Demographic Data Analyzer](Demographic Data Analyzer.py): 
In this project, I analyzed demographic data using **Pandas** 
with a given [dataset](adult.data.csv) that was extracted from a 1994 Census database.

[Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator](Mean-Variance-Standard Deviation Calculator.py):
Here, I created a function named `calculate()` that uses **Numpy** to 
output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, 
min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix.
>The input of this function should be a _list_ containing 9 digits.

[Medical Data Visualizer](Medical Data Visualizer.py):
In this project, I aimed to visualize and make calculations from medical
examination data using **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Pandas**. 
The [dataset](medical_examination.csv) values were collected during medical examinations.

[Page View Time Series Visualizer](Page View Time Series Visualizer.py):
For this project, I visualized time series data using a _line chart_, _bar chart_,
and _box plots_. I used **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn** to visualize a 
[dataset](fcc-forum-pageviews.csv) containing the number of page views each day on a
forum between a specific time inerval. 
>The data visualizations will help to
understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

[Sea Level Predictor](Sea Level Predictor.py):
I analyzed a dataset of the global average sea level change since 1880. 
I used the data to predict the sea level change through year 2050.
